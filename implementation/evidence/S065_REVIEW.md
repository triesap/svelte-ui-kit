Reviewer: separate Codex reviewer, not an author of the repairs. Date:
2026-10-07. Scope: Validate transient coordination and journal records.

Independently accepted on repaired candidate
`ce54d7d6a93f3f7dd2d1e25038390f6d95deb033`. The original checkpoint definition,
contract anchors, required tests, implementation report and applicable cumulative
RCLD04-R2-1..5 findings were compared with actual source, callers and evidence.
Original implementation provenance remains in [S065_REPORT.md](S065_REPORT.md).

Strict complete internal records bind transaction, plan, root, paths and coherent states. Malformed, contradictory, unreadable or unowned evidence fails closed; the frozen public metadata contract is preserved.

See [RCLD-04_QUALIFICATION.md](RCLD-04_QUALIFICATION.md) for the original-scope
assessment, independently executed causal checks, audited author cumulative
results, exact artifact identity and qualification limits. All applicable
S065 criteria pass. This does not accept later CLI/platform/release/MVP
requirements or waive AC20 debt.

Commit this review with the other S064–S077 records and atomically record the
reachable evidence anchor before entering S078. The code anchor above already
exists; no future or self-referential commit is claimed.
